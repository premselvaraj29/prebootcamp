Rule1:
Always assume your code will fail. Design your code to handle all possible errors.

Rule2:
Log your errors to server so that the backend team can look into it for resolving.

Rule3:
Always we should try to handle the errors and not the browser. 

    try - catch block or window.onError 

    Error life cycle is as follows:
    Error --> try-catch --> window.onError --> browser error

Rule 4:
Identify where errors might occur

    Type coercion errors:
        Occurs when type conversion is done
    Data Type errors:
        Occurs when inappropriate operations are performed on a different datatype
    Communication Errors:
        Invalid URL /post data
        Server response status
        No network connection
        Server response content

Rule 5:
Throw your own errors
Throw errors in low level blocks of code(libraries, utilites).
Use try catch in high level code(business logic)

Rule 6:
Distinguish fatal vs non fatal errors
Non fatal errors
    User will not notice abrupt errors on the screen and the user will not be stopped from using the service.
Fatal errors    
    User will not be allowed to use the service anymore until the error is resolved.

Rule 7: 
Provide a debug mode
