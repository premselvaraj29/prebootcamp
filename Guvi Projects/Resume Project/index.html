          <p>
            Developed an Excel VBA based tool that can extract data from the
            output of Dow PRD sizing tool to populate multiple PRD Documentation
            excel sheets. The tool was developed using Regular Expressions to
            extract text data based on patterns. The tool eliminates the manual
            entry and avoids human made errors. This lean initiative reduces the
            time taken for documentation from 45 min to less than 2 min and has
            a
            <strong>potential saving of 2000 man hours annually.</strong>
